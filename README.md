Student Marks Card (Props)

Description
- Simple demo showing parent-to-child data flow in React via props.
- `App` (parent) stores multiple students and passes each student object to `StudentCard` (child).
- `StudentCard` displays marks, calculates total, percentage, and grade.

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with Browser).
2. No build step required — this uses CDN React + Babel for a quick demo.

Notes
- This is a minimal, single-file demo for learning props and component reuse.
- For production use, set up a bundler (Vite/Create React App) and use module-based components.
